this is a game, on such applications the screen size should not exceed 100% height and 100% width,

I had to not use the specified sizes from figma to reach the right size for laptops .

in real life, of course, I myself would not change the indicated dimensions, but since it was not possible to ask and clarify with the designer, I made the decision myself
